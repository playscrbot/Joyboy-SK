Casino Hold'em Game
The objective of the game is to have a higher hand value than the dealer without exceeding 21.
**Commands:**
!play_holdem - Start a game of Casino Hold'em.
!help_holdem - Show this help message.

**Gameplay:**
- The bot will deal two cards to you and two cards to the dealer.
- Your hand will be shown, but only one of the dealer's cards will be visible.
- You can choose to 'hit' (draw a card) or 'stand' (end your turn).
- If your hand value exceeds 21, you bust and lose the game.
- Once you stand, the dealer will draw cards until their hand value reaches 17 or higher.
- The bot will reveal the dealer's hand and determine the winner.

**Card Values:**
- Number cards are worth their face value.
- Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10.
- Ace (A) can be worth either 1 or 11, whichever benefits the hand the most.
